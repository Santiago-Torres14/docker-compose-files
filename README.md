# Docker compose files

This Repo contains the docker-compose files to run the different services, some of them
need to configure environment variables to execute properly.

## How it works? 

Each docker-compose.yml file can be found in the corresponding branch. For example, the mongodb branch contains the docker-compose.yml file to run the mongodb service.

## How to run?

To run the docker-compose file, you need to execute the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
